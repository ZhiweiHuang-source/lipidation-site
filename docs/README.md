## Lipidation Types

Common lipidation modifications studied:

1. **N-myristoylation**
   - Motif: MGxxxS/T (where x is any amino acid)
   - Location: N-terminus
   - Enzyme: N-myristoyltransferase (NMT)

2. **S-palmitoylation**
   - Motif: Cysteine residues (context-dependent)
   - Location: Various, often near membrane
   - Enzyme: Palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs)

3. **Prenylation**
   - Motifs: CaaX box (C-terminal)
     - Farnesylation: CAAX (X = Met, Ser, Gln, Ala)
     - Geranylgeranylation: CAAX (X = Leu, Phe)
   - Enzymes: Farnesyltransferase (FTase), Geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase)

4. **GPI anchor**
   - Motif: Signal sequence for GPI attachment
   - Location: C-terminus
   - Complex enzymatic pathway
